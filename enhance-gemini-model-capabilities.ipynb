    "Cymbal Direct, the retail arm of Cymbal, wants to leverage the power of Gemini 2.5 Flash to gain a competitive edge in the basketball sneaker market. They aim to analyze competitor pricing, understand customer preferences, and generate synthetic data for testing new ecommerce features. You, as a data analyst, are tasked with using Gemini's capabilities to help Cymbal Direct achieve these goals. This will involve:\n",
    "  * **Code Execution**: Demonstrate the ability to execute Python code within Gemini 2.5 Flash\n",
    "  * **Grounding**: Use grounding to enhance the accuracy and relevance of Gemini's responses to questions about retail products.\n",
    "  * **Controlled Generation**: Retrieve information about basketball sneakers and their pricing from competitors using Google Search.\n",
    "  * **Synthetic Data Generation**: Structure the extracted product and pricing information into a predefined JSON schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to provide Cymbal Direct with actionable insights to refine their marketing strategy, improve their products, and bolster product positioning. Are you ready for the challenge?"

      "The Nike Air Jordan XXXVI, launched in 2021, is engineered for lightweight speed and performance on the basketball court, making it suitable for players seeking agility and responsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Features:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Materials:** The upper is constructed from a jacquard leno-weave, a lightweight, durable, and breathable material that offers support and allows light to pass through it. A ribbon of light, durable TPU wraps around the shoe between the sole and upper, providing side-to-side stability. The tongue is made of a neoprene-like material, offering softness, sponginess, and flexibility, with padding to reduce lace pressure.\n",
      "*   **Cushioning:** The shoe features a full-length Zoom Air Strobel unit stitched directly to the upper, bringing responsive cushioning closer to the foot. An additional Zoom Air unit is strategically placed under the forefoot for enhanced responsiveness and a \"burst of explosiveness.\" This double-stacked cushioning system aims to provide excellent energy return and impact protection.\n",
      "*   **Plate:** The Air Jordan XXXVI incorporates an evolved Eclipse Plate. This stabilizing shank, made of durable plastic, is located between the outsole and midsole, helping to prevent the shoe from twisting. In this iteration, the Eclipse Plate was reduced in material and separated into two pieces, focusing on the arch to further reduce weight and get the foot closer to the ground and cushioning.\n",
      "*   **Intended Player Type:** The design emphasizes being incredibly light and exceptionally strong, catering to basketball players who prioritize speed, quick changes in direction, and a responsive feel on the court. Its lightweight construction and advanced cushioning system are geared towards enhancing athletic performance.\n",
